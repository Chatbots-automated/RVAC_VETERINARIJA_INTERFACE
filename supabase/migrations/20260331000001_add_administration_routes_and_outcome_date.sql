-- =====================================================================
-- Add Administration Routes and Outcome Date - Complete Migration
-- =====================================================================
-- Migration: 20260331000001
-- Created: 2026-03-31
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This migration adds:
-- 1. Route-specific withdrawal periods for products (i.v, i.m, s.c, i.u, i.mm, p.o.s)
-- 2. Administration route tracking in usage_items and treatment_courses
-- 3. Outcome date field for treatments
-- 4. Updates all views and functions to support these new fields
-- =====================================================================

-- PART 1: Add New Columns to Tables
